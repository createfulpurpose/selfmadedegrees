General Education requirements really differ across colleges and universities.

For example, “STEM” colleges such as Caltech and Harvey Mudd often require at least four science courses as part of their GE program.

That aside, most university GE requirements tend to consist of 8-9 courses in a combination of writing, arts, humanities, and STEM. Depending on the school, foreign language and/or PE may also be required.
