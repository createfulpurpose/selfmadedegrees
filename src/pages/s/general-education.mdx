General Education requirements differ across colleges and universities.

For example, “STEM” colleges such as Caltech and Harvey Mudd often require at least four science courses as part of their GE program.

That aside, most university GE requirements tend to consist of 8-9 courses in a combination of writing, arts, humanities, and STEM. Depending on the school, foreign language and/or PE may also be required.

Due to the differences, you have a bit of flexibility in choosing what courses to take to count for part of your GEs. If you aren't sure what you should do, check out [IGETC](https://admission.universityofcalifornia.edu/admission-requirements/transfer-requirements/preparing-to-transfer/general-education-igetc/igetc/) for a good place to start.

## English / Writing

Usually a 2-course requirement (freshman composition plus an advanced course).

## Natural Sciences

Usually a 2-course requirement consisting of a biological science course and a physical science course, and at least one with lab.

<IntroductionToBiology />
<CellBiology />
<NaturalSciences />
<IntroductionToChemistry />
<GeneralChemistryI />
<AlgebraBasedPhysicsI />
<AlgebraBasedPhysicsII />

## Social Sciences

Usually a 2-3 course requirement. Sometimes a specific course in civics or American government is required.
