The goal of [Self-Made Degrees](/) is to provide an alternative route for self-driven, independent students who don't fit into the four-year university model, but still want to receive an equivalent education.

In a world where information is readily available, college isn’t that important anymore. (Disclaimer: it depends on your major/career, of course. For example, if you want to be a doctor, you can’t really get out of going to college.) Combined with [high tuition rates](https://educationdata.org/college-tuition-inflation-rate), [fewer students](https://www.bestcolleges.com/research/college-enrollment-statistics/#college-enrollment-over-the-years) are choosing to attend college every year.

## Why you might choose to study on your own

- **Your learning pace is a lot faster or slower than others your age**. That's fine! It's important to be able to go at your own pace while not burning yourself out, an experience universities fail to provide students with.

- **You want to learn something your college doesn't offer**. Maybe you're interested in UX design, but you're studying psychology because it's the closest degree offered at your university. Use [SMD](/) to help supplement your education!

- **You're interested in a career like art, design, or programming, where (in general) your portfolio and what you can do matters a lot more than what kind of degree you have.**

## How does Self-Made Degrees work?

[SMD](/) takes real academic plans from different universities and creates an equivalent study plan based on free online resources. After that, everything is completely up to you.

## Is this program really completely free?

Yes! We do list possible paid courses - no affiliation - that you can take (for example, if you want to take advantage of that free Coursera subscription your library offers). But there is always a free option.

If a resource is listed as free that actually isn't, please contact us at [email tbd!] and we will fix it right away.

## Is this an actual degree?

It is not. (Don't we wish it could be, though?) It is true there are many employers who still value a degree, so you should only choose [SMD](/) as an option if you are willing to:

- work harder than others around you
- be comfortable with failure
- chart your own career path
